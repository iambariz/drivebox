## 📦 Installation (Development)

Clone the repo and install in editable mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drivebox.git
cd drivebox
pip install -e .
```

### Download ffmpeg

DriveBox requires **ffmpeg** for screen recording.  
Run the helper script to download the correct binary for your OS:

```bash
python scripts/download_ffmpeg.py
```

This will place `ffmpeg` inside `drivebox/resources/ffmpeg/`.

## ▶️ Running the App

After installing:

```bash
drivebox
```

Or run directly:

```bash
python -m drivebox.main
```

## 🧪 Running Tests

We use `pytest` for testing:

```bash
pytest -v
```

## 📦 Building Executable (PyInstaller)

To build a standalone executable:

```bash

The output will be in `dist/drivebox/`:
